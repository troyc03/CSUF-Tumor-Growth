# CSUF-Tumor-Growth
This project combines **mathematical modeling** and **machine learning** to simulate and predict tumor growth over time. Using classical ODE models (logistic and Gompertz) and modern regression techniques, we aim to explore the dynamics of tumor growth from both theoretical and data-driven perspectives.
